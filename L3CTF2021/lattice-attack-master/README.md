# Lattice ECDSA Attack

Recover an ECDSA private key from partial "k" nonces data.

The partial "k" information can be recovered from side channels : timing gives its size (leading 0), modular operations can give parity, ...

This software requires at least 4 known bits per nonce : LSB (last bits known) or MSB (first bits known). It computes what is the minimum amount of signatures data required to recover the key, before performing the recovery.

It uses linear matrices and [lattice basis reduction to solve a Shortest Vector Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lattice_problem) from a Hidden Number Problem.


## Requirements

* Python3
* cryptography library
* fpylll library

cryptography : `pip3 install cryptography` or `apt install python3-cryptography`

fpylll : doesn't work in Windows, only in Linux.  
          -> `apt install python3-fpylll`

We recommend that you **install fpylll with the distribution package manager**. Else this requires lots of compilation tools and Python low level libraries. The package managers, such as apt or dnf, are providing all these, with pre-compiled binaries.


## Use

Read a JSON data file with the signatures, with the following keys :  
* The name of the curve, see CURVES_ORDER in ecdsa_lib.py  
* Target public key is given as list of the coordinates : [x,y]
* Message given as bytes integers list
* The type of bits known : "LSB" or "MSB"
* The number of known bits per secret k
* The signatures as a list of dictionaries, with integers values : {"r": intR, "s": intS, "kp": knownNoncePart }

```
{
    "curve": curveString,
    "public_key": [pubx, puby],
    "message": [a,b,c,...], // In case same message for all signatures
    "known_type": "LSB"/"MSB",
    "known_bits": 6
    "signatures": [ {"r": intR, "s": intS, "kp": leakednoncepart }, {...}, ... ]
}
```

2^known_bits is a upper bound for kp.  
Example if the LSB known for "k" are 0b000101 for a given signature  
 -> { "hash": xyz, "r": xxx, "s": xxx, "kp": 5 }  

"hash" needs to be provided as integer in the signatures data when there's no "message" key. That means each signature has its own hash.

MSB shall be provided reduced like LSB, means only the known bits :  
0b000101... -> "kp": 5  
If the known bits are all 0 : "kp": 0

Run :

```
python3 lattice_attack.py [-f data.json]
```

There's a demo mode, provided by `gen_data.py`. Before performing an attack, it generates a random EC key pair (private/public), signs many messages with this key, and builds the data file accordingly ("data.json" by default).

Call lattice_attack and gen_data with the "-h" argument to see more about the options.


## Real data

A real data set is provided in the [Data/ECDummyRPA directory](Data/ECDummyRPA).
